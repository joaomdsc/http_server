** Simulating a large Centreon installation

*** Hosts

Hosts called srvlnxNNN and srvwinNNN
Notes on hosts: db_server (x4), backend (x4), web (x4), a total of 12 servers
Host aliases 
DB hosts: transac, warehouse, historical, logging (one for each server)


*** Services (functional)

DB services: fct_transac_NNN, fct_warehouse, fct_historical, fct_logging
4 db servers, 5 services per host

Backend services: core, pricing, historization, logging (x5 on each server)

web x5 services on each host

A total of 60 services

** Host and service generation

Create a template through the UI, then use import/export mechanisms to create
object. It's unclear at this point if I'll be able to simply edit object
definition files (maybe once they've been created with the host or service id).

Use the CLI for updating the configuration:

    1. Generate config files (from what ?)
    2. Check/validate config
    3. Copy config files (to /etc/centreon-engine ?)
       3.5 Can I edit the object definitions here ?
    4. Re-start monitoring engine
    
** Check functions

Checks on hosts/services return 0 (ok) by default. They read json files
status_hosts.json and status_services.json where a different state may be
requested, this allows us to dynamically force state changes.
